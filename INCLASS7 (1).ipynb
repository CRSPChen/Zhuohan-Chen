      "The false information in the article is as follows: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. The release date of a spinoff game called War Thunder Mobile (also known as War Thunder Edge) in May 2023 for Android and iOS version released in August 2023 are obviously false, as at the time of answering this query, it's not 2023 yet. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. The claim that in 2019, War Thunder was among the most played games on Steam with over 25,000 concurrent players on Steam only, and in 2023, the number of people playing War Thunder simultaneously on Steam only was over 75,000 on average and peaked at 114,806 on Nov 05, 2023, cannot be verified, since the year 2023 has not come yet. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. The statement that as of November 1, 2022, War Thunder had over 70 million registered players on all platforms combined, out of which 160,000 play concurrently, and in February 2024, War Thunder set a new record of over 250,000 concurrent players is evidently false, as it's not yet 2022 or 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The article claims that in 2023, Gaijin introduced \"Mobile Infantry\", an event involving battles involving infantry wearing combat exoskeletons. Again, such a statement is definitely false as it's not 2023 yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The article also states that two nations were playable in the conflict, being the United States and Russia, and there were several types of playable exoskeletons in the 2023 event - which is obviously false since we are not in the year 2023 yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. The article also claims that other notable examples include \"March to Victory\", introducing playable mecha composed of tank parts; \"The Pony Nation\", introducing the world of My Little Pony, Equestria, as a sixth playable faction (2013); and \"Gaijilla\", featuring a battle against a giant Godzilla-like snail (2014) that cannot be verifed and seems implausible. \n",
      "\n",
      "7. The claim about the game having a tank biathlon-style event featuring select Russian and Chinese tanks performing tasks on a tank range map in August 2020, with the partnership with the Information Systems Department of the Russian Ministry of Defense, and the logos advertising the game also appeared during the event, notably painted on the side of the tanks during the real biathlon, is not verifiable and could very well be false. \n",
      "\n",
      "8. The article also claims that In 2022, Gaijin introduced a Dune-inspired game mode called \"Worm Thunder: Children of Arachis\" which involved two factions fighting over cinnamon in the desert while also avoiding being eaten by a giant sandworm - which is obviously false since 2022 hasn't happened yet.\n",
      "________UCLA________\n",
      "1. UCLA's academic roots were established in 1881 as a normal school then known as the southern branch of the California State Normal School which later evolved into San José State University.\n",
      "2. UCLA offers 337 undergraduate and graduate degree programs. - Correct number is around 300.\n",
      "3. Six of the schools offer undergraduate degree programs: Arts and Architecture, Engineering and Applied Science, Music, Nursing, Public Affairs, and Theater, Film and Television. Three others are graduate-level professional health science schools: Medicine, Dentistry, and Public Health. - Correction: Dentistry and Medicine don't offer undergraduate degrees.\n",
      "4. 410 Bruins have made Olympic teams, winning 270 Olympic medals: 136 gold, 71 silver and 63 bronze. - Correct number is 267 Olympic medals, not 270.\n",
      "5. In March 1881, at the request of state senator Reginaldo Francisco del Valle, the California State Legislature authorized the creation of a southern branch of the California State Normal School (now San José State University) in downtown Los Angeles.\n",
      "6. UCLA was permitted to award the master's degree in 1933, and the doctorate in 1936, against continued resistance from UC Berkeley.\n",
      "7. In February 2022, Matthew Harris, a former lecturer and postdoctoral fellow at UCLA, was arrested after allegedly making numerous threats of violence against students and faculty members of UCLA's Philosophy Department.\n",
      "8. In 2018, a student-led community coalition known as \"Westwood Forward\" successfully led an effort to break UCLA and Westwood Village away from the existing Westwood Neighborhood Council and form a new North Westwood Neighborhood Council.\n",
      "9. In 2022, UCLA signed an agreement to partner with the Tongva for the caretaking and landscaping of various areas of the campus. This included land use for ceremonial events and educational workshops and outreach events.\n"
